Hi!

If you are working on the server here are some handy environmental variables
you can set so that you can debug make test:

GEARMAN_VALGRIND <- runs the server under valgrind.
GEARMAN_MANUAL_GDB <-- runs the server under a remote version of GDB.
GEARMAN_LOG <-- generates a log file for you with the output of the debug for the server

GDB will pause the server while you do run the GDB command.

Cheers,
