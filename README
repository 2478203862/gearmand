Hi!

If you are getting this code from https://launchpad.net/gearmand
then continue reading. Otherwise these directions are not for you
(well maybe...).

To obtain code from https://launchpad.net/gearmand you will need to
issue the following command:

bzr branch lp:gearmand

Once the tree is branched you will need to build the "configure"
script. You can do this by running the script:

./config/bootstrap

It will set up all of the files you need to build gearmandc. At
that point it is just the typical "./configure; make; make test;
make install"

For a tarball release do a "make dist" and for an RPM type "make rpm".

For patches please create a branch on launchpad and propose it to be
merged into the trunk. You can find out more information on how to
do this at the launchpad help site:

https://help.launchpad.net/

Notes on coding style:

Variables during assignment should be like:
a= 12;

When in doubt, use (). It means I clearly know that you meant for an
operation to follow a specifc order.

Cast return types void when there is a possibility of failure (don't
bother with printf, use common sense):

(void)some_function(...);

New functions should be named "object_verb_(item_to_act_on)". You
should email the list if you are extending the API.

Use spaces after while, for, do, if, else. Don't around anything else.

If/else bracket style is:
if ()
{
}
else
{
}

Thanks and keep hacking!

Cheers,
